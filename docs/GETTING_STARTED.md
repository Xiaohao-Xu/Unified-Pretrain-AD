### Prerequisites

#### Choice 1: Directly set up the environment with the libraries below. 
The code is built with following libraries:

- Python >= 3.8, \<3.9
- OpenMPI = 4.0.4 and mpi4py = 3.0.3 (Needed for torchpack)
- Pillow = 8.4.0 (see [here](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/bevfusion/issues/63))
- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) >= 1.9, \<= 1.10.2
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
- [torchpack](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchpack)
- [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) = 1.4.0
- [mmdetection](http://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) = 2.20.0
- [nuscenes-dev-kit](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit)


After installing these dependencies, please run this command to install the codebase of this repo:

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

> Tip: [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja) is recommended to use before run the command above to compile the project faster!

#### Choice 2: Set up the environment with Conda or Docker. 

Use Pre-generated Conda Package, please refer to [conda-package/README.md](conda-package/README.md).

Use Docker, please refer to [docker/README.md](docker/README.md).


### Data Preparation

#### nuScenes

Please follow the instructions from [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/blob/master/docs/en/datasets/nuscenes_det.md) to download and preprocess the nuScenes dataset. Please remember to download both detection dataset and the map extension (for BEV map segmentation). After data preparation, you will be able to see the following directory structure (as is indicated in mmdetection3d):

```
mmdetection3d
├── mmdet3d
├── tools
├── configs
├── data
│   ├── nuscenes
│   │   ├── maps
│   │   ├── samples
│   │   ├── sweeps
│   │   ├── v1.0-test
|   |   ├── v1.0-trainval
│   │   ├── nuscenes_database
│   │   ├── nuscenes_infos_train.pkl
│   │   ├── nuscenes_infos_val.pkl
│   │   ├── nuscenes_infos_test.pkl
│   │   ├── nuscenes_dbinfos_train.pkl


```

After data preparation, remember to set/check the dataset path in `./configs/nuscenes/default.yaml`.
